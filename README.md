## Background

The global rise in myopia, particularly in Asia, presents significant public health
challenges. Analyzing trends and forecasting impacts are critical for developing strategies to mitigate this
burden.

## Methods 

We conducted the largest study to date on myopia and high myopia prevalence in Chinese
children and adolescents aged 7–18 years, analyzing data from 5,095,256 individuals across 119 studies
from 1998 to 2022. Data variability between cycloplegia and non-cycloplegia measurements was
addressed using a distance-based model averaging calibration. Aggregated prevalence and age-specific
urban-rural trends were estimated using thin plate spline regression, with projections to 2050 derived
from time series modeling.

## Findings

Myopia prevalence plateaued in 2006 in urban areas and in 2013 in rural areas, with the urban-
rural prevalence gap narrowing since 2015 (urban/rural ratio below 1·3 for all ages). By 2050, myopia
prevalence is projected to stabilize at 27·1% (95% CI: 10·0–44·4%) for ages 7–9 and 81·5% (74·7–
88·3%) for ages 16–18 in urban areas, and at 20·1% (8·6–31·7%) and 74·1% (63·2–84·8%), respectively,
in rural areas. High myopia prevalence among adolescents aged 16–18 is expected to rise from 7·3% in
2001 to 22·1% by 2050. Prevalence correlated significantly with the Human Development Index (P <
0·001).

## Interpretation

Despite stabilization in overall myopia prevalence, the continued rise in high myopia
underscores the need for targeted control measures. Projections emphasize the importance of addressing
regional disparities and prioritizing public health interventions.
